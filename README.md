# YouTube Trending Videos Analysis

YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the [top trending videos](https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending) on the platform.  
> “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”.

Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile “Gangam Style”), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.

The dataset we used, comes from Kaggle dataset ["Trending YouTube Video Statistics"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new), which was collected using the YouTube API. 
This dataset is a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos.


Our target is being able to predict if a YouTube video is likely to be trending or not. It is highly useful if you are:
- **A Youtuber** who wants to make trending videos. 
- **An advertiser** who wants to know the best videos to put advertisements on before they become trending videos. 
- **A researcher** trying to derive insight about behavior from YouTube trends.
