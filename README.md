# Youtube-trending-videos-analysis

YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the [top trending videos](https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending) on the platform. According to [Variety magazine](https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/youtube-2017-top-trending-videos-music-videos-1202631416/), “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”. Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile “Gangam Style”), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.

This dataset is a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos.

Being able to predict if a YouTube video is likely to be trending or not is highly useful if you are:
- **A Youtuber** who wants to make trending videos. 
- **An advertiser** who wants to know the best videos to put advertisements on before they become trending videos. 
- **A researcher** trying to derive insight about behavior from YouTube trends.

The dataset comes from Kaggle dataset ["Trending YouTube Video Statistics"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new), was collected using the YouTube API.
